WEFF : p2p Communication without Third Party (Deepsec 2023)

Ref : https://deepsec.net/speaker.html#PSLOT644

References in public available literature pertaining to a completely serverless connection method between two peers behind routers implementing NAT are scarce. In this talk we are describing a more generic method for NAT traversal that requires no intermediate server and relies on a multiple port testing method which resembles a brute force attack. A proof of concept has been created for verifying and demonstrating our results.

This talk relates to p2p communication without the need of a third party (intermediate server or other) for initiating the communication.
